      We show that the program {\sc flock} \citep{Duc&Tur2009} employs 
a model that is identical to the {\sc structure} 
\citep{Pritchardetal2000} model with no admixture and non-correlated 
allele frequency priors. The computational routine in {\sc flock} is 
formally equivalent to searching for the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) 
estimate of this restricted {\sc structure} model via a simulated 
annealing algorithm with an extreme (and likely suboptimal) cooling 
schedule.  Understanding {\sc flock} as a special case of the model in 
{\sc structure} allows a principled perspective on its expected 
strengths and weaknesses.
