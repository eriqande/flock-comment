# Simulating data

This should be pretty straightforward.  

I have set up the script sim_data.sh to simulate
data sets.  It is currently configured to simulate 5 data sets of
4000 individuals in 5 populations with Fst about 0.03 between the
pops and about 9 to 20 alleles at each of 15 microsat loci.

You can run it like this:

```sh
./sim_data.sh
```
